# 3D Graphics Engine Desktop App (C++)
This is the Source Code Repo for my 3D Graphics Engine, written in C++.
I am using an API called SFML for displaying a window and drawing 2D lines and triangles ONLY. All 3D work and math is programmed from scratch by me.

Features:
- Multithreading
- Perspective Projection
- Triangle Clipping
- Loading in 3D OBJ files
- Torus Shape
- More shapes to come in the future

I Recommend checking out Torus.cpp, my latest addition - Can create toruses with a specific radius, radial segments, and ring segments.
