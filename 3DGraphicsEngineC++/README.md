# 3D Graphics Engine Desktop App (C++)
This is the Source Code Repo for my 3D Graphics Engine, written in C++.
I am using an API called SFML for drawing in 2D.

Features:
- Custom Multithreaded 3D graphics pipeline
- Perspective Projection
- Triangle Clipping
- Loading in 3D OBJ files
- Torus Shape
